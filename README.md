## Description

A set of scripts that handles downloading, creating a venv, building, extracting, and installing pyinstaller to prevent false positive viruses.

This is only for **Windows 8 or greater**

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choosing.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your Windows operating system (Windows 8 or higher).

3. Ensure you have either mingw OR chocolatey installed. (chocolatey is used automatically to install mingw64).

4. Open a terminal in inside of the cloned directory.

5. Run command `python run.py`

6. Once the process is complete an explorer window will automatically be opened for you, you can copy the path to `pyinstaller.exe` (don't copy the file) and in another terminal/script or where ever you can utilize this custom pyinstaller to build binaries for your python programs.
